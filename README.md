# Breathing Room
### A Mouse-Based Horror Game by Stanny Huang

*One failed experiment led to your ungodly creations free from their containment. Horribly injured from the chaos that ensued, you are left gravely injured and helplessly exposed to the mistreated monstrosities eager to enact their revenge. As you lie immobile against the far reaches of your office, your only hope for survival is to pray your abominations remain ignorant of your hiding spot...*

"Breathing Room" is a 2D horror game controlled purely through your mouse. Left alone and defenseless, you must avoid detection from the monsters outside your office by controlling the sound of your breathing. Gameplay is heavily inspired from the likes of the FNAF series.

**Can you Survive?**
